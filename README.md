# Chaos Fault Injection

TODO:

- Package level documentation
  - Default do nothing if request fault or config is invalid
  - Use multiple middleware if you want slow + error
  - Dynamic configuration left up to the user
- Maybe get rid of DROP fault type?
- Provide docker image to make requuests against
- GitHub Actions to run CI
- Readme shows how to launch godoc
- Makefile for tests, docs, docker
- Benchmarks
- Implementation examples
- Implementations for non net/http middlewares?
- Link to initial proposal
